###What is doing?

Generate a random name taking two parameters: min and max with of the word. It will then generate a word between this two values.

###How it work?

It will generate a string where vowel and consonant alternate. But there is 20% chances the letter after one of them can be the same type. And a little little chance the third letter can also be a vowel if the serie started with vowel (not possible with consonant). You can also modify the type of letter by forking the code obviously.
